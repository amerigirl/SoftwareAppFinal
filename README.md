The ultimate vault for movie lovers who believe that all the coolest films deserve to be in one place! Whether youâ€™re a cinephile on the hunt for classics or just want to browse through a gallery of iconic posters, The Treasure Trove is your digital movie chest, ready to be explored.

The Treasure Trove is a modern web application that lets you search, browse, and discover a curated list of legendary movies. Each film comes with essential details and a vibrant poster, making it easy (and fun!) to find your next watch or reminisce about your favorites.

About The Tech Stack

This tech stack is built with React and Next.js for a fast, interactive, and responsive user experience.  In the backend, the application uses Flask and SQLAlchemy, providing a robust API and a flexible database to store only the most awesome-est of movies! SQLAlchemy ORM handles all the movie data, making it easy to manage and expand the collection.

**The Treasure Trove is currently a minimum viable product. While it already lets you explore a movie list and view details, some features are still in the works. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to expand this cinematic treasure chest!
